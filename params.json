  "body": "### What it is\r\n\r\nSimpleBackup provides a graphical interface to run the zip command.  Many of the zip command's options are available for use through this application.  The goal of this application is to make it easy to create and update backups of large amounts of data.  For example, you can create a backup of your home directory and run this application regularly to make sure the backup is up to date.  SimpleBackup also accepts command line options, so it is easily scriptable and can be used with scheduling applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Brief history\r\n\r\nThis application was started in early September 1999 for the purpose of creating a simple interface to the zip command for creating large backups in BeOS.  It was originally intended for only my own personal use, however after adding several features I decided that other people may have some use for this application as well.  I have made many changes since version 1.0 (see Changes section below).  Version 2.0 was updated to run on Haiku.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nTo install SimpleBackup download the latest release file ending with \".hpgk\". Open the downloaded file and you will see a description of the package and a button to complete the installation.\r\n\r\nSimpleBackup is now ready to run.  The only external file required is the /bin/zip command, which is included with Haiku.  I have also included a sample settings file called \"home_backup_settings\" which will back up your /boot/home directory recursively except for the Mozilla and Opera cache folders. This file is located in /boot/home/config/settings/SimpleBackup (the default settings folder) but you can move the file anywhere else you want to keep it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to use this application-\r\n\r\nSelect a source directory or file by typing the path into the \"Source:\" text box or by clicking the \"Browse...\" button to select a file or directory.  Then select \"Create New Backup...\" to create a new zip file or \"Update Existing Backup...\" to update a previously created zip file.  Below these buttons are optional settings that can be modified to change the way the backup is created.\r\n\r\nPlease see the ReadMe file for more detailed description of all the settings available to customize your backups.\r\n",
